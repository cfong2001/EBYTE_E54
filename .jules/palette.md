## 2024-07-24 - Responsive Vertical Spacing for Multi-line Screens
**Learning:** Hardcoded Y-coordinates and background box heights cause text overlap and overflow when accessibility text scaling (`uiTextSize`) is increased.
**Action:** Always dynamically calculate bounding box heights (e.g., `numLines * lh + padding`) and Y-coordinates (e.g., `baseY + lh + offset`) based on the current line height derived from font scale (e.g., `lh = 8 * uiTextSize`).
## 2024-05-24 - Avoid hardcoded colors for UI flexibility and decouple themes
**Learning:** Hardcoding absolute colors like `TFT_WHITE` or `TFT_DARKGREY` breaks visual consistency across different UI themes, leading to unstyled bounding boxes or illegible text when the background color changes. Inlining theme-specific logic (`if (theme == THEME_ALIEN)`) within the rendering code reduces modularity and scalability.
**Action:** Use dynamic theme variables like `themePrimary` or `activeTheme.text`. For structural elements, use `sprite.alphaBlend()` to generate shades contextually, e.g. `sprite.alphaBlend(128, themePrimary, themeBg)`. Extend the base `Theme` struct to handle optional overrides (`hasSweepOverride`, `sweepOverride`) to maintain a clean separation of concerns and keep rendering code data-driven.

## 2026-07-31 - Explicit Network Status & SVG Accessibility
**Learning:** Polling dashboards can silently fail when network disconnects, leaving stale data. Also, inline SVGs require camelCase `viewBox`, `role="img"`, and `aria-label` to be parsed and read properly by assistive technologies.
**Action:** Always add explicit visual connection states (e.g. `● LIVE` / `● OFFLINE`) on polling dashboards and explicitly declare roles/labels and correctly cased viewBox attributes on inline SVGs.
