## 2024-05-19 - Defer math.sqrt calls in display loops
**Learning:** Found a performance bottleneck where `math.sqrt()` was being called on every target inside rendering loops solely to find the minimum distance for text display. On constrained embedded hardware, evaluating `math.sqrt` inside tight loops causes measurable overhead.
**Action:** When finding the closest target distance, track `closest_dist_sq` by calculating squared distances (`x*x + y*y`) inside the loop, and apply `math.sqrt()` to the final `closest_dist_sq` outside the loop before rendering.
